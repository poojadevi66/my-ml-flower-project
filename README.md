## Flower Classification using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to classify different species of flowers based on their features. Using a dataset that includes attributes such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width, this project aims to predict the species of a flower.

### Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to build and evaluate various classification models that can accurately predict the species of a flower based on its physical attributes. 

### Key Features:
- **Dataset:** The project uses a popular flower dataset (e.g., Iris dataset) with features such as sepal/petal length and width.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming the data to ensure that it is ready for machine learning.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing the distribution and relationships between the features and the target class.
- **Machine Learning Models:** The project explores different classification algorithms such as:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Trees
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- **Model Evaluation:** Performance of the models is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other classification metrics.

### Tools & Libraries:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

### How to Run:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or the Python script to see the results.

### Results:
This project aims to demonstrate the capability of machine learning to solve real-world classification problems, and the accuracy of different models will be compared for optimal performance.
